What is the purpose of wire-framing?

keep the concept user-focused, clarify and define website features, quick and cheap to create

What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

low mid and high. 

low is useful because they are quick, informal, and disposable designs

mid is usefule beacause they are essentially like low but more detail is assigned to specific components, and features are clearly differentiated from each other

hight is useful because they are detailed visual designs and can demonstrate the quality of your work

Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

yes, because they show the layout and/or detail of your work in a visual concept
