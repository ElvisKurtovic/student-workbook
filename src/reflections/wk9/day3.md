How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?

Smaller agile teams fail fast and mature faster. They can develop as a team much faster. Smaller agile teams have the ability to learn, unlearn, and relearn in way that is simply unmatched by larger teams.

Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.

So that you can focus on one aspect that needs to be completed unless two teams are working from the same backlog. Each team can now work on their own active sprint simultaneously.

What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?

A maxim that high-quality goods delivered quickly and efficiently to customers will always come at a higher price and vice versa.

Once you have understanding the tradeoffs on each side of the unattainable triangle allows a project team as a whole to set and accept realistic expectations.
