In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

Rows are complete objects (e.g., book) and columns are specific properties (e.g., title, author, etc.)

Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called characters with the values name, age, description as strings, and an int id.

--  CREATE TABLE characters
-- (
--   id INT AUTO_INCREMENT,
--   name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
--   age DECIMAL(2 , 0) NOT NULL,
--   description VARCHAR(255),
--   PRIMARY KEY (id)
-- )

What is the difference between the following statements:

DELETE FROM table_name; deletes a record from a table
DROP TABLE table_name; deletes the entire table
