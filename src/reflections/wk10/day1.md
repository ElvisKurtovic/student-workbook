What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value type - directly contain their data
Reference type - store references to their data (objects)
Pointer type - holds the memory address of another type

What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

 bool
 byte
 char
 decimal
 double
 enum
 float
 int
 long
 sbyte
 short
 struct
 uint
 ulong
 ushort

In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

Reference types are stored in the GC heap. The reference is stored in a stack while the object is allocated in the heap.

While when a value-type instance is created, a single space in memory is allocated to store the value.
