What is the purpose of a Query String?

allows you to pass information to and from a website by adding that information to the end of a URL

such as ?answer=42

What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

the format would be key=value starting with a "?". 

you would distinguish using "&"

When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?
