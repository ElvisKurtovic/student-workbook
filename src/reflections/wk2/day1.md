What is Scope ?

essentially means where these variables are available for use

What is Hoisting ?

a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution

In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

let if you want to declare a value that isnt global. var if you want to declare it globally. const if you want to declare a value that cannot be changed but only in the block you're working on
