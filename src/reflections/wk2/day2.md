What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

funciton decleration, function expression, arrow function expression.

function decleration is hoisted. function expression is not hoisted. arrow function expression do not create their own "this" value.

What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

parameters are used when defining a function. arguments are the values the function receives from each parameter when the funcion is invoked

What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?

when a function accepts another function as a parameter. 
array.prototype.map
