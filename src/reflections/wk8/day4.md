What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit Testing - allow you to test individual units of code in isolation.
Component Testing - give users the ability to realiably view components mounted to the DOM while also providing Vue-specific conveniences such as integrations for Vuex, Vue Router, and other Vue plugins.
End-To-End (E2E) Testing - validate all of the layers in your application

What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

All testing is useful beacuse without testing you do not have a way to see if your code is working and/or why its not working.

What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

No testing methods should be clasified as "least useful", they are all useful.
