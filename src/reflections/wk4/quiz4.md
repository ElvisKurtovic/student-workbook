# UnderStanding Asynchronous Code, and API's

**1.** What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
synchronous code happens in squence, it loads code in order from top to bottom

asynchronous code doesnt wait for the sequence and lets other code load while it gets the information it needs to load itself
```
**2.** What is an event listener?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
it reacts to an input or signal by calling the event's handler
```
**3.** What does the `O` represent in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
open-closed principle
```
**4.** What is a callback / higher order function?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
A function that accepts other functions as arguments is called a higher-order function, which contains the logic for when the callback function gets executed
```
**5.** What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
completion or failur of an asynchronous operation

.catch()
```
**6.** Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
request line, headers, body

::: get, post, put
```
**7.** What does the `API` acronym stand for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
application programming interface
```
**8.** In the `MVC` design pattern, who is responsible for making calls to `APIs`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
service
```
**9.** What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
to prevent the user from being able to see/manipulate all your data/code

::: data bundling
```
**10.** What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
2xx Success

200
```
**11.** What is a 500 error?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
 Generic error response. It means that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request
