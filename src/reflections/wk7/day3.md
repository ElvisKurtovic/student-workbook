What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

every interaction your business has with people on your website, mobile site, apps, and online properties or services

how your online and app experiences are making people feel. Are you confusing them? Are you coming off as cold and uncaring? Are you rushing them?

What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

you can create strong UX that arranges all of your information and interactions in a way that's pleasing to people. And, when the UX of your site or app makes people feel good, they're more likely to stick around and become customers.


Why is the User Experience important?

Because a typical user will not see your code nor do they care about it, they just want it to do what it's designed to do. So creating the best user experience will lead to more users and returning users.
